## Mobile Ambients in Common Lisp

### Overview

This library provides an API for Cardelli & Gordon's Mobile Ambients. I have tried to develop the library to match as closely as possible with Cardelli & Gordon's presentation, and also to be relatively idiomatic Common Lisp. In addition, the library is extensible, allowing programmers to introduce new types of processes, capabilities, and to define transitions for them.

### Documentation

The library has complete documentation (generated by CLDOC). There is also a guide that describes the system and works through a number of the examples. Slides from a short (10 minute) presentation about the library are also available.

### Example Usage

A simple example of getting things up and running follows. (This is from LispWorks; other Lisps may produce slightly different output.)

    CL-USER 1 > (cd "~/tayloj/mobile-ambients/")
    #P"/Users/tayloj/tayloj/mobile-ambients/"

    CL-USER 2 > (compile-file "mobile-ambients")
    ;;; Compiling file mobile-ambients ...
    NIL

    CL-USER 3 > (load "mobile-ambients")
    ; Loading fasl file /Users/tayloj/tayloj/mobile-ambients/mobile-ambients.xfasl
    #P"/Users/tayloj/tayloj/mobile-ambients/mobile-ambients.xfasl"

    CL-USER 4 > (in-package #:mobile-ambients-user)
    #<The MOBILE-AMBIENTS-USER package, 1/16 internal, 0/16 external>

    AMB-USER 5 > (run-process
                  (par (open 'm (named 'P))
                       (amb 'm (named 'Q))))
    ; *. open M.P | M[Q]
    ; 0. open M.P | M[Q]
    ; 1. P | Q
    #<P | Q>
